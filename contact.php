        Although suggested by the form's action in the code,
        this file was not included in the original project.</p>
        <p>If the user wishes Contact Me to appear on the portfolio,
        user must supply a Contact email address.</p>
        <p>Server-side validation may be included in this file
        in the event that client-side (javascript) validation is blocked.
        Original project does not seem to require any form fields;
        at least an e-mail address should be required.</p>
        <p>Do not forget to copy and include PHPMail scripts for this process.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, what happens after the email is sent?
        Redirect to index?</p>
        <p>ENOUGH WITH THE NOTES! Please Click BACK.</p>
        <p>(And, having clicked Back, the form disappears, making validation trickier.)</p>
        <p>This file might create session variables based on the input data,
        which would hold their values until either the upper-right X is clicked
        for cancellation or until the email is successfully sent.</p>"
